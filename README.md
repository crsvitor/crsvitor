Hi, I'm Vitor

Software engineer that doesn't update his github or linkedin very often... Since 2021 I work in a bank, and all software and product development is kinda private, so might answer why I don't have a green github.

Going back to me... I'm brazilian, very talkative in english and portuguese. <br>
I formally study Science and Technology, in UFABC - a great university in Brazil. <br>
And informally I focus in upskilling business soft and hard skills.

I code in JavaScript/Typescript, and Python. <br>
I've already had experience with Vue.js, and I am currently focused in backend development with Python.

Any thought you might wanna share with me, my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/crsvitor/.
